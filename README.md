# QuickFIX Messenger
QuickFIX Messenger is a front-end messaging application built on-top of the [QuickFIX/J](http://www.quickfixj.org) engine.

It is a tool designed for technical individuals working on the Financial Information eXchange ("[FIX](http://fixprotocol.org/)") Protocol. The FIX Protocol is an industry-driven messaging standard for the electronic communication of trade-related messages.

QuickFIX Messenger is ideal for testing different messages and scenarios on FIX infrastructures. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for constructing and sending FIX messages across a given FIX session.
